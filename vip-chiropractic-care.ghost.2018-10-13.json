Take Regular Breaks\\n\\nLong periods of sitting down and looking at a computer monitor or pouring over paperwork can be taxing on the body and the mind. Even though you might be reluctant to take advantage of breaks due to your workload, it’s important that you do. Taking even short breaks can actually improve focus, boost energy and increase your overall productivity and sense of wellbeing.\\n\\n2. Bring Your Own Lunch to Work\\n\\nA good step towards greater wellness at work is to bring a healthy lunch with you and avoid eating out or being tempted by unhealthy office treats. When lunch hour rolls around, try to find a place other than your desk to eat such as an outdoor park or common area. Getting out of the office for a short period can provide some much needed relief and get your body moving.\\n\\n3. Take the Stairs\\n\\nIf you work in a multi-story office, skip the elevator and head for the stairs. Many studies indicate that humans who take at least 10,000 steps per day enjoy greater health. However, sitting at your desk all day can make that a tall order, so take advantage of those stairs to boost your heart rate and help strengthen the core and leg muscles.\\n\\n4. Create a \\\"Workout\\\" Work Space\\n\\nIf company policies allow for it, you can create a mini workout zone right in your office. Consider investing in a standing desk or a treadmill that can double as a work zone when you need to get some exercise and still be productive on company time. Mini steppers are also popular options that can fit right under your desk and can help you enjoy a healthy workplace.\\n\\n![5777a4a375f1786af00535a17e958dd1](/content/images/2018/03/5777a4a375f1786af00535a17e958dd1.jpg)\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<ol>\n<li>Take Regular Breaks</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Long periods of sitting down and looking at a computer monitor or pouring over paperwork can be taxing on the body and the mind.

The unique advanced Selective\nFiltration technology has an affinity for  impurities, so it attracts them, but\nit has no affinity for healthy  minerals, so it allows them to remain.\n\nWater as mother nature intended it to be  \nWhen your water is pure yet healthy with essential minerals, it’s the  way\nnature intended drinking water to be. By contrast, residential  filters that\nwork with reverse osmosis filter out everything, including  the minerals your\nbody needs for good health. As far as nutrition goes,  experts consider it\nessentially dead water.\n\nPURE AND HEALTHY WATER – WITH NO MORE BOTTLES IN THE FRIDGE\n\nEliminates lead (99.9%), heavy metals, chlorine (99.9%), chromium 6,  mercury,\nvolatile organic compounds, carcinogens, and other  contaminants, as well as\nturbidity, odors and bad tastes. So you and  your family enjoy pure, healthy,\nspring-fresh water from the tap.\n\nMuch healthier than water filtered by reverse osmosis\n\nFilters that work by reverse osmosis remove everything, even the  essential\nminerals. That’s why water filtered by RO is described by many  experts as\n“dead” water.\n\n\nWoder-10K-DC - Longer lasting for superior value                             \n\nWoder filters last for a minimum of 3 years with normal use. That’s as much as 6\ntimes longer than many filters.\n\nWhy?\n  \nWoder filters use micro-particles, so the filters contain far more  filtering\ningredients. This difference gives them the highest capacity  to purify your\nwater for years while they remain optimally effective. \n\nPURE AND HEALTHY WATER – WITH NO MORE BOTTLES IN THE FRIDGE\n\nPLEASE NOTE:​​\n\nUse with municipal treated cold water only\n\nFor longest life, do not use with salty or softened water. Do not use with well\nwater. Do not use with hot water. \n\nWoder filters have a unique technology that removes over 99.99% of contaminants\nwhile leaving in all essential mineralsWhat are essential minerals?\n\nEssential minerals are ingredients that your body does not produce  naturally\nbut that are  necessary for your health and well being. They  include:\n\nCalcium  – Your body  needs calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Calcium\nalso plays a role  in nerve transmissions, muscle function -- including that of\nthe heart  -- and hormone secretion.\n\nPotassium  – Potassium  controls the electrical activity of your heart, making\nit vital to  maintaining a normal heart rhythm. Your body also needs it to build\n proteins, break down and use carbohydrates, maintain the pH balance of  the\nblood and support normal growth.\n\nSodium  – Although  too much sodium can increase your risk for developing high\nblood  pressure, your body needs sodium to stimulate nerve and muscle function,\n maintain the correct balance of fluid in the cells and support the  absorption\nof other nutrients including chloride, amino acids and  glucose.\n\nMagnesium  – Your  body needs magnesium to support more than 300 biochemical\nreactions.  Magnesium supports muscle and nerve function, keeps your heart\nbeating  regularly, builds strong bones and boosts immunity\n\nPhosphorus  – Phosphorus plays an important role in building strong bones and\nteeth, producing proteins the body needs and repairing cells.\n\nChloride  – Chloride,  usually consumed as a salt compound such as sodium\nchloride -- better  known as table salt -- balances the fluids in your body and\nplays an  essential role in the production of digestive juices in the stomach.\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n     WODER PREMIUM WATER FILTERS - Enjoy pure, healthy water on tap            \n                                                                               \n                                              \n\n\n\nALL SET IN FIVE TO TEN MINUTES\n  \nWoder 10K-DC comes with everything you need to install it in minutes.  Includes\nfilter body, inlet hose and outlet hose that fit standard  pipes, quick clip,\nand screw. Leak free!\n\nWoder 10K-DC comes as a complete assembled kit.\n\nIncludes: Filter body, inlet hose - 3/8 female compression by 1/4  standard pipe\nthread, outlet hose- 3/8 m compression by 1/4 standard  pipe, clip and screw.\n\nFINEST MATERIALS\n\nWoder filters are built with materials approved  and tested by  independent\nlaboratories, so you can have complete confidence in the  quality of\nWoder-filtered water.\n\n\nShould I be concerned about total dissolved solids?All healthy water has a\ncertain level of total dissolved solids. These are the essential minerals. So\nTDS meters are not an effective way to measure water quality.  In fact, water\nwithout any TDSs is considered “dead” water and not healthy for drinking. It is\nmost often produced by reverse osmosis. \n\n\nUnmatched Benefits\nWith a Woder filter, you’ll enjoy:\n\nUnmatched Filtration Safe, pure – 99.9% free of contaminants Healthy drinking\nwater – with essential minerals vital to your health Fresh-tasting water – as\nrefreshing as spring water Healthier skin – naturally softer, smoother, and more\nbeautiful Cleaner dishes – without watermarks
